our_localization_bag1: uses mymap.pgm
						starts rough, puts in initial guess, moves robot around. Slowly converges to 2 points. As you can see, waiting a long time in one spot for it to converge.
our_localization_bag2: uses mymap.pgm
						immediate intial guess of location. Move around full map, ends in same place started. one of the points it was converging to was almost exactly where robot was.
