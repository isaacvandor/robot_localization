## Code Architecture Plan
### What classes will you create for your implementation (everyone should have a ParticleFilter class as given in the starter code, but more are probably better)?

### What functions will be implemented in these classes?

### If you will be using the code in the helper classes, how will your code utilize them.

### Define a timeline of how the code will interact with the sensor data coming from the robot and generate update estimates of the robot's location.
